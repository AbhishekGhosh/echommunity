1485258872.000007> @U37GZRZU6: :loudspeaker: Dear members of <#C0KP6DWSG> , this is to announce that a revolution for defining an efficient method for collaborative work has begun! Anyone interested in this -critical- issue is welcome to join the discussion :wink:  As the signal/image processing and embedded systems communities are growing, we need to set up some methods to facilitate the communication between different parts of the project, and at the same time it would be great to define efficient ways of keeping a documentation up-to-date with the latest developments.  Below are listed the points we would like to address :  1. Gather pieces of information about the current state of the developments (hardware, embsys, sigproc, app) in a unique place so that anyone - especially newcomers - can have an overview of the whole project. The critical point here is to define a way to maintain the documentation up-to-date, otherwise it's useless ! As a first step towards this, we could begin to reference the current state of the kit being developped by <@U07UEJC2H>. <@U07UEJC2H>, <@U0AAL4W13> and I could help you to do this, do you think it would be possible to get a set of modules so as to test the kit ? Then the idea is to plug into the same documentation, some insights about embedded systems / signal processing / app --&gt; <@U38HVMZ6K> , <@U3QGT3Q74> could you help us do that ?  2. Be able to clearly identify people involved in each part of the project, as well as keeping a track of their respective contributions (e.g. the forks of echopen github repos, the wikis/docs produced by different members, internship reports...) --&gt; <@U0AAL4W13>, <@U38HVMZ6K> and I have started working on this part, the idea is to use slack/github bots and a google form to map the knowledge/skills in the community. We'll then use a graph database to store information and build some kind of "recommender system" allowing each member to identify interlocutors / github projects / documentations that would be of interest for them. The dedicated github repo is here : <https://github.com/kelu124/echommunity> (this is temporary, a specific repo on the echopen github might be created soon)  3. Define a way to facilitate the discussions between each part of the project so as to be able to make decisions that are consistent the one with each others. This is because the choices made at the embsys/sigproc/software stages strongly depend on the hardware, for example. <@U0AAL4W13>, <@U38HVMZ6K> and <@U3QGT3Q74> have interesting ideas about that, but nothing is fixed yet.  Again, anyone who would like to help us is welcome! <@U04DFTZ7D> <@U0GMX7QUB> this might interest you :wink: (reactions: @U0B47KC3S,@U0AAL4W13,@U38HVMZ6K,@U0AAL4W13)

1485271703.000012> @U04DFTZ7D: Thanks you <@U37GZRZU6> it's a great idea :wink: We need to get the method evolved as the community is growing and the diffrent groups are moving forward. To give some insights :  1. to gather information, we planned on using github with a dedicated repository for each projetc. This include synthesis of discussions on dedicated channel on slack and reports of meetings as well as any other commons knowledge we should share. Actually, <@U38HVMZ6K> did it for the embedded system with the reports of the meetings that are on the embsys repository on github.  2. In each repository should state a readme with the list fo the people involved in each sub-project :wink: And with <@U0GMX7QUB> script we might soon be able to display it on the documentation static website !!  Then, i agree with you, we need some table of advancement and next steps. We set ip up before on the wiki, but we probably now need to set it up for the all sub-project along with the issues and challenge. issues to be solved durong weekly meetings and challenges to be adressed to specific membres of the community with specific skills.   We should also setup the repository on the echOpen organization on github and adding all existing content we have everywhere (drive, wiki, etc.) using pandoc to transform each format into readable markdown format.   The idea then to start this work would be to organize a dedicated workshop sur as a CAPMeth :wink: What do you think ? (reactions: @U0B47KC3S)
1485276509.000014> @U0B47KC3S: thank you <@U04DFTZ7D> <@U37GZRZU6> indeed, the need of an overview of projects with their dedicated advances, challenges, issues + a transversal stack of specs, aka all the technical infos that can be shared across projects is now of critical importance !
1485280236.000015> @U04DFTZ7D: So are you guys, <@U37GZRZU6> <@U0B47KC3S> <@U0GMX7QUB> <@U0AAL4W13> and others, interested by organizing a CAPMeth :wink: early february ? What about February the 11th from 10.00 to 16.00 ? I guess one day would be good as we already have most of the process and info that need to be structured. I also sahre with you a first document that i prepared a few weeks ago. Feedbacks are welcome !!
1485280432.000016> @U0B47KC3S: <@U04DFTZ7D> what you have in mind is a CAPMeth to fix some docs or something more meta, about methods on methods ? I would prefer something quite practical :wink: (reactions: @U0FN1B8KD)
1485280467.000017> @U04DFTZ7D: <@U04DFTZ7D> and commented: Feedbacks are welcome :wink:
1485280603.000018> @U04DFTZ7D: <@U0B47KC3S> both.  1. fix the docs (e.g. the previous doc) and others (e.g. starter kit, etc.) 2. and explore possible methods and solutions to architecture the project giving to all an overview of the global project in time and space.  3. Making sure we all agreed on common process.   Is that plan good for you guys ? (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1485280738.000019> @U0AAL4W13: family meeting on 11th for me :/
1485280791.000020> @U0AAL4W13: what about  publishing  this text as a public gist so that we can collaborate on this gist ?
1485280825.000021> @U04DFTZ7D: It's the plan
1485280827.000022> @U38HVMZ6K: Newbie question... What is a CAPMeth?
1485280861.000023> @U04DFTZ7D: CAP is a workshop to take a direction like a cap :wink: And then we add Tech for technical, Med for medical, etc. and Meth for method :wink:
1485280984.000025> @U04DFTZ7D: From now on i'll setup the repository and add few documents for us to share and prepare. I'll add the slides with the process i designed last year. Just need a few days to set it up
1485281183.000026> @U0FN1B8KD: What about a new "rapport détape" in english
1485281184.000027> @U0FN1B8KD: ?
1485281195.000028> @U0FN1B8KD: we did one in february 2016
1485281245.000029> @U0FN1B8KD: Could be a way to sum up what happened and then move forward, and every work group can fill its part

1485281759.000037> @U0AAL4W13: <@U0FN1B8KD> y'a meme la version finale de ce rapport d'avancement (qui avait été imprimée) ci dessous.
1485281762.000038> @U0AAL4W13: <@U0AAL4W13>
1485281792.000039> @U37GZRZU6: <@U04DFTZ7D> thanks for the sharings :slightly_smiling_face: It's a good idea to organize this CapMeth, let's do it! As the methods will concern people from the different projects, I think it's important that at least <@U07UEJC2H> <@U0AAL4W13> and <@U38HVMZ6K> take part to the workshop, + others who already thought to those issues - i.e. <@U04DFTZ7D> <@U0GMX7QUB> <@U3QGT3Q74> <@U0FN1B8KD> <@U1N5Q9334>  hope we can find a date that will be suitable for everyone !  We'll have the opportunity to gather all the initiatives that people took till now, as a newcomer I'm really curious to discuss with <@U0FN1B8KD> and <@U0GMX7QUB> of what they did in the past :wink:
1485281823.000041> @Hyacinthe: <@U0FN1B8KD>
1485281844.000042> @U0AAL4W13: <@U37GZRZU6>  you may also consider inviting <@U0FN1B8KD> who did a great job at consolidating various aspects of our work, as well as <@U1N5Q9334> who contributed to the startkit gitbook.
1485281884.000043> @U04DFTZ7D: Sure !! And we will open a call on slack for anyone willing to participate (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1485282006.000046> @U37GZRZU6: <@U0AAL4W13> sure I pressed "enter" too early and my message was posted before I had finished writing :smile:
1485282019.000047> @U04DFTZ7D: Great, so let's do it !! who's IN to help organizing ? (Structuring the agenda, expected outcomes, etc.).  When it will be done, we will launch a Facebook event, sending invite to the community using emailing and announce it in the general slack channel.
1485282074.000048> @U04DFTZ7D: Sure, good idea. Would you taking care of it ?
1485283238.000049> @U37GZRZU6: <@U04DFTZ7D> I'm in! first things first : can we fix a date rapidly ? would the 4th of february be too early ? <@U38HVMZ6K> <@U07UEJC2H> <@U0AAL4W13> <@U0FN1B8KD> <@U0GMX7QUB> <@U1N5Q9334> what do you think ?
1485283291.000050> @U04DFTZ7D: I will only be available February the 11th. The 4th already busy :disappointed:
1485284420.000052> @U0AAL4W13: <@U04DFTZ7D> so the agenda is : 1. fix the docs (e.g. the previous doc) and others (e.g. starter kit, etc.) 2. and explore possible methods and solutions to architecture the project giving to all an overview of the global project in time and space. 3. Making sure we all agreed on common process.  ?  ---&gt; I'm not sure if a Cap is the right time for fixing the doc.
1485284505.000053> @U0AAL4W13: @all - what would you expect from such a meeting?  (is that normal that @ channel isn't working??)
1485284614.000054> @U0AAL4W13: I believe there are two steps: one is for having an audit of the existing (which can then be summarized in a "Interim report" as suggested by <@U0FN1B8KD> -- and that could be a project lead by one of us here) and the other is the way to redirect the newcomers to this existing mapping. The last part is to ensure all that is produced is well published and easily accessible by all (if I summarize)
1485284627.000055> @U04DFTZ7D: That was just a suggested agenda ! Then fixing the doc should be done in advance to eventually complete it during the workshop. 
1485284642.000056> @U0AAL4W13: +1
1485284706.000058> @U0AAL4W13: There has been several works to summarize the existant (existing inception report, starterkit, functional analysis) -&gt; we could for example for the time being try to list all that we can think of ? (for the first item) -&gt; that could be a brainstorm session during the workshop.
1485284729.000059> @U0AAL4W13: Knowing that would be a plus for knowing what perimeter we're covering.
1485284776.000060> @U0AAL4W13: But let's keep what we can do at home outside of our physical meeting - and use this precious together time for what we can't do online?
1485284804.000061> @U04DFTZ7D: Exactly what I suggested earlier !! Summarizing the existant  would be the first things to do
1485285146.000063> @U0AAL4W13: Hum I'd start with a listing, not a summarizing .. that's going to be far more work than only a couple of hours of a meeting :wink:
1485285223.000064> @U04DFTZ7D: Sorry I'd would say gather the existing document. Just copy/past your text... sorry
1485285247.000065> @U0AAL4W13: :smiley:
1485285511.000066> @U0AAL4W13: so first part fine with doing an inventory of what we have?
1485285549.000067> @U0AAL4W13: btw <@U04DFTZ7D>  is that normal that the "@ channel" doesn't work?
1485285570.000068> @U04DFTZ7D: That would be great ! Including what we have in the wiki, and everywhere else. 
1485285604.000069> @U04DFTZ7D: For the second question, I don't know, I have to check. I am in the train with a very bad service. I'll check it later this week 
1485285632.000071> @U38HVMZ6K: Sorry a bit lagging behind in the discussion (daughter and now wife sick at home...). I won't be able to do it neither on 4th nor on 11th but I will contribute as much as I can before and eventually during the event remotely :flag-ch:  
1485285707.000072> @U04DFTZ7D: Thanks <@U38HVMZ6K> but the idea will be to prepare as much as we can before and then having an open call here on the slack and anyone will be welcome to join anytime 
1485285798.000073> @U38HVMZ6K: OK then if it's not physically in Paris I can perhaps do it on 11th (reactions: @U04DFTZ7D)
1485286721.000074> @U0FN1B8KD: olivier: <@U0AAL4W13> would you help me luc,
1485286721.000076> @U0FN1B8KD: 
1485286723.000077> @U0FN1B8KD: ?
1485286829.000079> @U0AAL4W13: Depends when it is :smiley:
1485286854.000081> @U0AAL4W13: But for the interim report, I was leading it last year, would be a pleasure to help someone else :smiley:
1485287125.000083> @U0AAL4W13: So two topics so far: Mapping of existing, Interim report ?
1485287134.000084> @U0AAL4W13: <@U38HVMZ6K> <@U37GZRZU6>  other ideas?
1485287144.000085> @U0AAL4W13: <@U0FN1B8KD> <@U1N5Q9334> as well?
1485287191.000086> @U0FN1B8KD: the only thing is that we are already late on the santé public project so would like to finish that first ... (we have the grant deadline)
1485287682.000088> @U04DFTZ7D: And missing the way to follow up the global project as <@U37GZRZU6> mentioned it earlier  (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1485287720.000089> @U0AAL4W13: yes
1485287764.000090> @U0AAL4W13: This point will need to be articulated with the  starterkit - one its objectives being to answer this need ?
1485291207.000091> @U37GZRZU6: <@U0AAL4W13> <@U04DFTZ7D> yes, global overview of the project which goes with the starterkit, + need to define a way to have some exchange / feedback between different parts of the project so as to be able to make decisions together (as in the end, all parts are strongly related the one to each other)
1485291283.000092> @U37GZRZU6: this point is more about defining a methodology - that can be transversal meetings, or I don't know, whatever can help information to propagate among all sub-projects
1485291418.000093> @U38HVMZ6K: &gt; <@U38HVMZ6K> <@U37GZRZU6>  other ideas? Discussions/brainstorming on the way to organize and structure sub-projects for example: - standard directory layout for repos (doc, src, meeting minutes,... whatever is useful) so that when jumping into a new project or as a new member navigating the repo is easier - general github workflow (forks + PR + maintainers or branches) (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)
1485292791.000094> @U0AAL4W13: Excellent. For the first point it'd be interesting to have <@U0GMX7QUB> to get his advice on the existing structure. I agree having at least a doc, a src folder could be a minimum,  a minutes one would be as well most useful. One principle: KISS? We could build the session on seeing existing repos and seeing from a perspective of documenters, what have been useful and what has been missing? Agree as well for the GH workflow. This one could be simple: a simple MD file for the steps to follow?
1485296551.000096> @U0AAL4W13: <@U37GZRZU6> <@U04DFTZ7D> I'm freeing Saturday 11th, let's fix this date?
1485297790.000097> @U37GZRZU6: go for it ! <@U38HVMZ6K> <@U3QGT3Q74> <@U0FN1B8KD> <@U0GMX7QUB>  <@U07UEJC2H>  <@U1N5Q9334> is february 11th ok for you ? :slightly_smiling_face:
1485297844.000100> @U3QGT3Q74: <@U37GZRZU6> I'm ok for the 11th ! (reactions: @U37GZRZU6)

1485417580.000119> @U04DFTZ7D: Hello all, so as mentioned yesterday, i started a document to prepare the CAPMeth :wink: According to the current process, i created the dedicated repository (PRJ-commty_method) and added both license (CC BY SA) and the CAPMeth document. It is available following this link : <https://github.com/echopen/PRJ-commty_method/blob/master/20170211CAPMeth.md>. (reactions: @U0AAL4W13,@U38HVMZ6K,@U37GZRZU6,@U0B47KC3S,@U2PFHNN3C)
1485418517.000121> @U0AAL4W13: couple of questions/remarks (will be pushing those when from home - what perimeter? asso projects or community wise projects? - follow-up on a weekly basis: seems overly exaggerated:) let's try a monthly? - objectives unclear: expected outcomes: is this a kickoff meeting or a production meeting? I would rather go for a kickoff meeting defining the work of this project in the coming time AND follow up later using the methods devised during the meetig
1485418526.000122> @U0AAL4W13: main two cents
1485418598.000123> @U0AAL4W13: we can avoid using this together time to do what we could all do from home behind screens
1485418625.000124> @U0AAL4W13: it's maybe what you meant, just clarifying
