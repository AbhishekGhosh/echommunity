1478030373.000003> @U04DFTZ7D: <@U2X419KJS>: here we can talk about public health !! And impact 
1478030623.000004> @U2X419KJS: Great, <@U04DFTZ7D> !
1478030753.000005> @U2X419KJS: Well I would like to know if you already have a plan or we must create one
1478030853.000006> @U2X419KJS: And how is the workflow?
1478073943.000002> @U04DFTZ7D: Dear <@U2X419KJS> we have disccused the public health impact matters, but we do not yet have a plan to explore it. So if you want to create one, you are welcome :wink:
Usually, when someone is intereted in exploring a specific question, we let him/her taking the lead on the topic and then we try to mobilize the community to work all together. 
How would  you consider working on this topic and what would be your needs ?
1478077042.000003> @U0B47KC3S: btw, you should know that we can connect you to the eco-system of french medicine students, specialising in public health -
1478112351.000002> @U2X419KJS: That's great! Well first of all
1478112392.000003> @U2X419KJS: we must be able to build one prototype
1478112403.000004> @U2X419KJS: in Peru
1478112437.000005> @U2X419KJS: As I told you I'm electronics engineer
1478112457.000006> @U2X419KJS: and Miguel is physician
1478112477.000007> @U2X419KJS: rest of our team has the same skills
1478112682.000008> @U2X419KJS: I think the money is our main challenge
1478112747.000009> @U2X419KJS: We could present the echopen to different national or regional contests
1478112805.000010> @U2X419KJS: How do you handle this topic? About fundraising?
1478125453.000002> @U0B47KC3S: hi <@U2X419KJS> perhaps we should schedule a skype about this challenging topic. What do you think ?
1478128849.000002> @U2X419KJS: For me, it's OK.
1478128981.000003> @U2X419KJS: Meanwhile, we could start with a draft of the plan
1478129022.000004> @U2X419KJS: Is Google Docs OK for u ?
1478129150.000005> @U0B47KC3S: sure it is Ok
1478140338.000006> @U2X419KJS: I have only the info email. Which are your emails for sharing the doc?
1478543263.000002> @U0B47KC3S: <@U0B47KC3S> set the channel topic: dedicated to echOpen's social impact and public health issues
1478689192.000002> @U04DFTZ7D: <@U2X419KJS> did you received the email adresses i sent you ?
1478693892.000002> @U2X419KJS: Hi <@U04DFTZ7D> yes, I did. I will create a Google Docs
1478694022.000003> @U04DFTZ7D: Wonderfull !! Remain at your disposal ;)

1479117053.000006> @U04DFTZ7D: Thank you <@U2X419KJS> it’s great. How would you organize the development now ? Maybe it would be nice to write down some first insight and then we will mobilize some member of the community to join and add feedback, ideas and such. What do you think ? We already have a few people interested in this topic. 

To let you know more about the medical aspects of the project, please see this document : <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dDmV-sMrCLdtwd9k11UL-t6TSR78zH596wkF8029xR8/edit> (it’s a google translated document from a workshop held at echOpen a few month ago) and i added a copy in the sharded folder.
1479121981.000008> @U2X419KJS: Great! It's a good example 
1479121998.000009> @U2X419KJS: You have important information
1479122046.000011> @U2X419KJS: I was thinking to ask Open Biomedical Initiative
1479122100.000012> @U04DFTZ7D: Yes, sure. That would be great to engage Open Biomedical Initiative !!
1479122100.000013> @U2X419KJS: How they are validating their prosthetic and incubator
1479122126.000014> @U2X419KJS: Oh, they are my friends
1479122157.000015> @U2X419KJS: I think if you want after our first meeting
1479122182.000016> @U2X419KJS: We could schedule an second meeting with them :)
1479122291.000017> @U04DFTZ7D: Sure, that would be great. But could you confirm your availabilities for our first meeting ?
1479130591.000002> @U2X419KJS: I asked Miguel and he can participate the next week. This week we have the APEC and we will be part of some meetings
1479130610.000003> @U2X419KJS: Please let me know if it is possible
1479134712.000004> @U04DFTZ7D: Great, next week will be perfect, let us know.

1479171070.000002> @U0B47KC3S: hi there, a word to say that we will pitch echOpen in a session organize by the center for Translational Science of Institut Pasteur International Network about clinical trials on animals. The idea is that Institut Pasteur have developed humanised mices with liver and humanised immune system. This conference is also held by Institut Curie, one reference cancer center, which also developed animal models cc <@U0FN1B8KD>
1479171096.000004> @U0B47KC3S: Just a word of context : we have built up a working group with Institut Pasteur, in order to calibrate the future trials. We identified some pathologies : liver -&gt; cancer, differential diagnosis of liver mass and thyroid surgery -&gt; diagnosis of goitre #position #vascularisation.

1479315169.000010> @U04DFTZ7D: Wonderful !! and then we will mobilize more people within the community as soon as we will have setup the method and the goals of the project. Looking forward for the skype on Monday…
1479369538.000002> @U04DFTZ7D: Just talk with <@U32UWGGN9> also interested in the topic ;) he will work with us on gathering the current medical common knowledge of echOpen ;) he is a public health student based in Paris. <@U32UWGGN9> I let you give more detail about your profil ? 
1479375171.000003> @U32UWGGN9: Hi sure!
I am happy to work with you on the public health impact. I will try to assemble the knowledge on medical aspects of the project in the near future. On the long term, I am interested in assessing the public health impact of echOpen :slightly_smiling_face:
I studied at SciencesPo and a <http://M.Sc>. in epidemiology afterwards. I have expertise in epidemiologic studies and some evaluation skills. Will be happy to contribute!
1479422203.000004> @U0FN1B8KD: We set the core stone for collaboration with IRD in order to investigate the interest of the echopen probe on liver applications and especially in Laos, where acces to medical imaging and anatomopathology is very scarce, and liver pathology letals (cancer and parasits in particular). This will be a 3 year clinical research project starting in september 2017 and working with IRD. With IRD researchers together, we are to prepare the protocol and apply for a european grant (Pierre et Marie Curie) . Anyone interested in this topic should not hesitate to join.
1479423428.000005> @U0B47KC3S: indeed amazing working diner :wink: besides clinical trials concerns (see <#C2MAANG0P>), some researchers gave some parasitology highlights where I learned that some parasites infects and disrupts crickets neuro-system and get them to throw themselves to water, just because they need water to complete their reproduction cycles
1479423428.000006> @U0B47KC3S: loved it cc emilie !

1479810940.000002> @U04DFTZ7D: <@U2X419KJS> thank for your time yesterday, it was very interesting :wink:. To sum up our discussion i understand that you would be interested in both medical and technical aspect of the project. 
- Building with you local community an echOpen dev kit, following our documentation (that we will soon release) i’ll send it to you ASAP. This topic is discussed in the channel <#C07NJQ6LE> 
- Working on medical impact of such a device

Could you describe how you would consider working on the medical impact analysis ?
